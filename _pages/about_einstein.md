I'm a second year Applied Math major with a minor in Computer Science at Columbia University.

My previous academic passions were in functional analysis, elliptic partial differential equations, as well as computational biology. Now, my research interests transferred to Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Applied Mathematics. Particularly, I'm fascinated by the application of machine learning models in CV fields such as object detection and recognition.
